    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Scrambled eggs is a dish made from eggs (usually chicken eggs) stirred, whipped or beaten together while being gently heated, typically with salt, butter, oil and sometimes other ingredients</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ui>
        <li>4 eggs (large)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of half-n-half</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp of Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>black pepper (for serving)</li>
        <li>fresh chopped herbs (for serving)</li>
    </ui>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <oi>
        <li>In a medium mixing bowl, aggressively whisk together the eggs, half-n-half, and salt until the mixture is uniform in color and texture, and is light and foamy, without any separate streaks of yolk or whites</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in a small nonstick pan over medium heat, until the butter coats the whole pan and just starts to foam</li>
        <li>Add the eggs to the center of the pan and immediately reduce the heat to medium-low</li>
        <li>Wait for the edges to just barely start to set, then using a rubber spatula, gently push the eggs from one end of the pan to the other; continue this process, pausing in between swipes to allow the uncooked egg to settle on the warm pan and cook, gently pushing the liquid to form the curds</li>
        <li>When the eggs are mostly cooked, with big pillow-y folds, but still look pretty wet, slowly fold the eggs into itself just a couple times, bringing them together</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat when the eggs still shimmer with some moisture</li>
        <li>Transfer to serving plates; finish with some freshly cracked pepper and chopped fresh herbs</li>
    </oi>
